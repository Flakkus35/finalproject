All your plans are located on the sidebar under Plans and can be added through your profile page. By default every new user starts with a "Home" plan that will show up every time this page is loaded. It is recommended that you put your most viewed links on this page so you have easy access to them. The "Waypoints" tab in your profile allow you to add new links and well as see your full collection. Any link that has it's plan labeled as "None" or if you have more than 8 links under one page will not show up in any plan page but will show up here. Feel free to edit your plans and waypoints as you see fit. The Social tab on the sidebar act as a quickbar for any well used social links you have. Just scroll over to the social tab in your profile page to start adding them.
